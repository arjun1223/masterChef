first, you want to butter the untoasted soft bread. Do this carefully and slowly and try not to rip the bread. after you have covered both sides of both slices in butter, you then put them on a pan on the stove. wait for the butter to melt and for the bread to absorb it and become a nice golden brown. put a slice of cheese on top of one of the slices and quickly pick up the other slice and put it on top. these hot slices, along with the heat of the pan, will melt the cheese. You are now done! YAY! you have a grilled cheese sandwich. enjoy and  make this again, as it is very easy to make and tastes quite good.
